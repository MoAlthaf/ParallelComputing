# Distributed Genetic Algorithm for Route Optimization

## Project Overview
**Implementation of a parallel genetic algorithm using MPI4PY for solving vehicle routing challenges in urban environments.**

### Algorithm Explanation
This solution employs evolutionary computation to address the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), optimizing delivery paths to minimize total distance traveled while meeting all constraints.

**Data Initialization:**
- Loads connection matrix from CSV (city distances)
- Configures GA parameters (population scale, mutation probability, etc.)
- Seeds random generators for consistent reproducibility

**Population Initialization:**
- Generates 9,500 unique candidate paths
- Each path begins at depot (node 0) with randomized node sequence

**Core Evolutionary Process:**
**Iterates for 210 cycles:**
- **Fitness Assessment:** Computes path quality metrics
- **Convergence Monitoring:** Detects solution plateaus
- **Population Refresh:** Regenerates 90% of population after 6 stagnant generations
- **Parent Selection:** Competitive selection process
  - Conducts 5 selection rounds
  - Each round evaluates 4 candidate solutions
- **Genetic Recombination:** Implements PMX crossover operator
- **Diversity Maintenance:** Applies 12% mutation probability
- **Population Update:** Replaces underperforming solutions
- **Solution Tracking:** Logs optimal path metrics per iteration

**Final Outputs:**
- Identifies most efficient discovered route
- Displays path sequence and total distance

**Key Components:**
- **Path Quality Evaluation:** Computes route feasibility and efficiency
- **Competitive Selection:** Implements multi-round elimination
- **Genetic Operators:** Preserves node ordering during recombination
- **Solution Space Management:** Adaptive population refresh strategy
